Lending Club Case Study for the upGrad and IIITB Machine Learning & AI Program (September 2024 cohort) focuses on exploratory data analysis and provides recommendations based on EDA findings.

Problem Statement: This case study focuses on a consumer finance company deciding loan approvals based on applicant profiles. The challenge lies in minimizing business loss from rejecting creditworthy applicants and financial loss from approving risky ones. Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the aim is to analyze past loan data and uncover patterns influencing loan defaults.

Business Objective: The project seeks to identify key factors driving loan defaults to refine risk assessment processes, reduce credit losses, and optimize the companyâ€™s loan portfolio. Additionally, it emphasizes maintaining accessibility to lower-interest loans while mitigating risks through improved decision-making.

The analysis approach for this project involves the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
   - **Univariate Analysis:** Examining individual variables such as loan amount, income, and loan status to understand their distributions and trends.
   - **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis:** Identifying relationships between variables like loan default rates, employment length, income ranges, and verification statuses.
3. **Feature Identification:** Highlighting key factors (e.g., loan term, DTI, income level) that strongly correlate with loan defaults.
4. **Visualization:** Creating graphs and charts to illustrate insights effectively, such as default rates by loan term, income range, or employment length.
5. **Business Implications:** Deriving actionable insights from the analysis to enhance loan approval decisions and minimize financial risks. 

This structured approach helps uncover meaningful patterns and trends to guide risk management and decision-making strategies.
